1.3.0
=====
Jun 21, 2016, 7:09 PM GMT+10 (AEST)
- User request #21
  - Implemented ability to discover multiple meta files in directories
    instead of just one
- Fix issue #23 
  - Raise ambigious error if a step resolves to more than one StepDef at runtime
- Fix issue #24
  - Change stepdef parameter interpolation for dry run mode so that 
    `$<name>` becomes `$[param:name]` (otherwise it forever recurses)
- Implement enhancement #25
  - Add support for passing directories to the `-m/--meta` option instead of 
    just files. All meta files within a specified directory will be recursively

1.2.1
=====
May 24, 2016, 7.23 PM GMT+10 (AEST)
- Issue gwen-interpreter/gwen-web#24 
    Fixed tag filtering to accept tagged features and scenarios that have at 
    least one specified include tag and exclude all specified exclude tags. The 
    specified include and exclude tags are now partitioned and evaluated 
    separately (as per above) instead of being logically ANDed together from 
    left to right.
- Only dump environment on failure when in batch mode

1.2.0
=====
Apr 12, 2016, 10.01 PM GMT+10 (AEST)

  were passed in.

1.1.0
=====
Feb 29, 2016, 8:50 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added support for configuring a ramp up interval (in seconds) for 
  staggered parallel execution ~ for user request issue #18. The 
  interval can be set through the `gwen.rampup.interval.seconds` setting
  This setting is only applicable for parallel execution mode. If it is 
  not set or is set to zero, then no staggering will occur (as per default 
  behavior). 
- Added new `gwen.report.suppress.meta` setting for controlling whether or 
  not meta reports should be generated with HTML reports (default value is 
  false). If you have a lot of meta, suppressing the meta reports can 
  save a lot of disk space. Enabling this setting does not suppress the 
  hyperlinked stepdefs in feature reports (they will always be rendered).

1.0.3
=====
Feb 11, 2016, 11:33 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Do not allow StepDef names to start with keywords Given, When, Then, And or But
