/**
  * Manages and maintains an in memory stack of [[ScopedData]] objects
  * for a particular scope and provides convenient access to all attributes. 
  * Individual steps utilise this to access any data in the stack at any time.  
  * Collaborating steps can pass data to each other through this stack.
  * 
  * The scope at the top of the stack is always the currently active one.
  * When a new scope is created, it is always added to the top of the 
  * stack.  Therefore, newly created scope automatically becomes the
  * currently active scope, and the previously active scope (and any
  * others beneath it) move down one level in the stack.
  * 
  * Attributes are always bound to the currently active scope (the one at
  * the top of the stack).  They cannot be bound to any of the other non active
  * scopes lower in the stack. Once an attribute is bound to a scope it is never
  * removed from that scope, and therefore cannot be replaced.  It can be 
  * overshadowed though by another attribute of the same name in a higher scope.  
  * In such cases where a scope contains multiple attributes of the same name, 
  * the most recently added scope always shadows the former when a lookup is 
  * performed.
  * 
  * Attributes can be looked up in one of two ways:
  * 
  *  - By currently active scope: using the `get` method
  *    
  *    - This lookup scans the currently active scope and all other scopes below 
  *      it in the stack that have the same name.
  *  
  *  - Or by a nominated scope: using the `getIn` method
  *    
  *    - This lookup scans all scopes in the stack that have the nominated scope 
  *      name.
  *     
  * Although their visibilities are different, both lookups return the first
  * attribute found and scan from the top most visible scope down to the lowest.
  * This ensures that the most recently bound value for an attribute is always
  * returned if found.
